<section><p>Thout has detected that you are connecting via Tor. In order to use
Thout you must connect via <a
href="https://torproject.org">Tor</a>.</p>

<p>Thout allow participants to collaboratively share, store and access
documents. The kinds of documents shared using Thout are the kinds of
documents authorities may wish to suppress, such as embarassing
information or evidence of criminal activity. Two characteristics of
Thout make it more difficult for authorities to suppress these
documents.  First, Thout does not store any documents centrally.
Second, documents shared by participants may be replicated on multiple
machines. With multiple copies stored in browser caches and no central
server to sieze, suppressing leaked documents is much more
difficult.</p>

<p>If authorities aren't able to suppress leaked documents directly,
they may harass those accessing or sharing the documents, to limit
document availability indirectly. This is where Tor comes in. Without
Tor, your IP and that of other Thout participants can be traced. In
order to protect yourself and other Thout participants, Thout requires
that everyone use Tor. With Tor, anonymous document access and sharing
is possible, thus reducing the risks for participants.</p>

<p>Please connect to Thout using <a
