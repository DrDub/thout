<h1>Welcome to Thout</h1>

<p>Thout has detected that you are connecting via Tor. In order to use Thout you must connect via <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor</a></p>

<p>Thout allow participants to collaboratively share, store and access documents. The kinds of documents shared using Thout are the kinds of documents authorities may wish to suppress, such as embarassing information or evidence of criminal activity. Two characteristics of Thout make it more difficult for authorities to suppress these documents. First, Thout does not store any documents centrally. Second, documents shared by participants may be replicated on multiple machines. With multiple copies stored in browser caches and no central server to sieze, suppressing leaked documents is much more difficult.</p>

<p>If authorities aren't able to suppress leaked documents directly, they may harass those accessing or sharing the documents, to limit document availability indirectly. This is where Tor comes in. Without Tor, your IP and that of other Thout participants can be traced. In order to protect yourself and other Thout participants, Thout requires that everyone use Tor. With Tor, anonymous document access and sharing is possible, thus reducing the risks for participants.</p>

<p>Please connect to Thout using <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor</a></p>
